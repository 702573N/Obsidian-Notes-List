Dataview Snippet To Show Notes In Different List Views

## Story
All Obsidian users switched from some other note-taking programme (such as Evernote, Apple Notes, Standard Notes, Bear Notes) to Obsidian. When switching, many users lack a list of all notes with a small excerpt of the text and, if applicable, a thumbnail image. This Dataview snippet makes it possible to retrofit this missing view with a single line of code. All that is needed is the Dataview plugin.

## Setup
1.  Install "Dataview Plugin" from the external plugins
2.  Create a new folder called "notesList" or any other name and paste the files "view.js" and "view.css" into it

3.  Create a new note or edit an existing one and add the following code line:

    ````
    ```dataviewjs
    dv.view("notesList", {pages: "", view: "normal"})
    ```
    ````
    
    If you paste the main files (js/css) into another folder then "notesList", you have to replace the name between the first quotation marks.
 
 4. There are 2 different variables to set path/location as "pages", list view style as "view".
